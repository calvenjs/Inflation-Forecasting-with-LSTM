# Inflation-Forecasting-with-LSTM
The recent release of consumer inflation data showed prices rose at the fastest pace since 1982. Inflation forecasting is key in the conduct of monetary policy and can be used in many other ways such as preserving asset values. This notebook attempts to perform time-series forecasting using ARIMA and LSTM.

This repository contains jupyter notebook involving data visualization and time-series forecasting on inflation using ARIMA model and multivariate LSTM.
